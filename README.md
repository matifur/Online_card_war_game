# Terminal online card war game

The topic of the project was the development of a network game with a server supporting clients' card war game. The game was written using the socket library in Python. The program allows two players to play in real time. It is possible to run multiple games at the same time. The programs use IPv4 and Unicast addressing. In order to prevent packet loss, the TCP protocol was used, which will be responsible for communication between the server and the client.

Detailed documentation can be found in this repository.
